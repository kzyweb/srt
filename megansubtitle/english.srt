1
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,900
Hey, sweetie. I got something
that'’s gonna make you feel better.

2
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,190
<i>Purrpetual petz
are just like real pets,</i>

3
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,636
<i>except that when you talk to
them, they actually talk back!</i>

4
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,120
Amazeballs!

5
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,330
<i>There'’s over
six different petz to collect,</i>

6
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,020
<i>each equipped with their own personalities
and entirely spontaneous reactions!</i>

7
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,470
Careful. That'’s my butt.

8
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,440
<i>They speak
eight different languages.</i>

9
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,440
<i>They can take pictures.</i>

10
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,480
Come on, sweetheart.
Find the lens.

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,790
<i>And with the customized
app, you can even feed your friend.</i>

12
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,990
<i>But not too much!</i>

13
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,420
Uh-oh. Cleanup on aisle seven.

14
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,260
<i>The app is updated
with new content daily,</i>

15
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,970
<i>so you can do
almost anything together.</i>

16
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,360
<i>You can watch YouTube videos,
learn fun facts,</i>

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,810
<i>play multiplatform games,
buy accessories for your pet.</i>

18
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,010
<i>With so many options, what
will you and your pet do next?</i>

19
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,330
Mmm, jelly berries
makes me feel good.

20
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,956
Cady, look. We'’re almost
at the top of the mountain.

21
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,920
Can you see the hotel?

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,130
Ooh, well, that'’s interesting. Do
you know what else is interesting?

23
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,970
Oopsie-Daisy!

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,486
I thought we were gonna limit
screen time to 30 minutes a day.

25
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,426
What are you telling me for?
I didn'’t give it to her.

26
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,836
I'’m just saying, I think... cady,
can you turn it down, please?

27
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,900
I need to go to the bathroom.
Are we there yet?

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,780
If we make rules,
we need to stick to them.

29
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,970
If she wasn'’t on that,
she'’d be climbing all over.

30
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,840
So you would rather she
sat there feeding a toy virtual food

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,090
until it shits itself?

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,810
Cady, turn it down.

33
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,330
I already did turn it down.

34
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,570
What was Gemma thinking?

35
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,616
"It'’s my niece'’s birthday.
I'’m gonna get her a present."

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,546
She works for
the company that makes them.

37
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,650
She probably didn'’t even have to
pay for shipping.

38
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,690
Honestly, what is the purpose of a toy
if you have to play with it on an iPad?

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,490
This is what
the future looks like, okay?

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,410
You just have to get used to it.

41
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,620
Oh, my god!

42
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,700
And away we go!

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,140
- We'’re all right.
- We should'’ve put chains on the car.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,041
Neither of us knew that was a thing
until, like, ten minutes ago, okay?

45
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,560
Don'’t act like it'’s my fault.

46
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,640
Oh, my god! Ryan! Seriously!

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,090
What do you want me
to do? Mom, I dropped Leroy.

48
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,210
Why did you tell that guy at
the gate this was a four-wheel drive?

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,531
- Help me, cady.
- It looks like a four-wheel drive.

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,090
Cady, what are you doing?

51
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,571
- Cady, cady. Jesus Christ!
- Cady, put your seat belt on!

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,340
- I can'’t see anything.
- So stop moving forward.

53
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,690
We can'’t just sit
in the middle of the road.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,760
Look,
we'’ll wait for this to clear,

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,766
and then find some place
where we can pull over

56
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,910
and just wait for one of those
snow trucks to clear the road.

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,560
Yeah,
how long is that gonna take?

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
<i>Funki,
a toy company for the future.</i>

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,210
<i>Remember,
the key to fun is funki.</i>

60
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,670
- Why are we doing this?
- Because we have to.

61
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,910
If we could at least show him
what we have,

62
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,430
he would... no. Mm-mmm.

63
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,390
You said so yourself.
Not until she'’s ready.

64
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Hey.

65
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,190
Is that what I think it is?

66
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,470
Transparency looks good.

67
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,920
Yeah, well, for what
we paid for it, it better.

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,160
Okay, here we go.

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
Happy.

70
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,230
Okay.

71
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,580
Sad.

72
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,030
Confused.

73
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,390
Wait, wait. Stop.

74
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,830
Why is her face doing that?

75
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,350
What is happening?

76
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,240
I... I Don'’t know, Gemma.
It'’s your code.

77
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,040
Yeah, thanks.
I know it'’s my code, Cole,

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,870
but she doesn'’t look confused.
She looks demented.

79
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,010
You want me to
take the skin back off?

80
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,530
- Well, she'’s not responding. So...
- Okay, here we go.

81
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh, shit. It'’s
stuck. just be care...

82
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,740
Hey, Don'’t tear it.

83
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,056
I know. I'’m not gonna tear... ow.

84
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,090
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

85
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,990
Okay, so what do we do?

86
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,230
I guess we gotta open the door.

87
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,510
Gem.

88
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,860
What in the name of
ever-loving Christ is this?

89
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,110
David, if you just give me
a minute to explain...

90
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,110
Is this why you moved your lab,
Gemma? So you can keep secrets from me?

91
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,150
No, no, no.
We talked about this, David.

92
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,770
We talked about you putting it on
ice until you had a new petz model.

93
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,810
How much did you spend on this?

94
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,400
Are you even aware

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,986
of the shit Tsunami that just
swept in over this furzeez spot?

96
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,290
I'’m sorry, what?

97
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,936
Are we supposed to be
worried about that? It'’s a rip-off.

98
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,970
You'’re right, Gemma.
It is a rip-off.

99
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,840
They do the exact same thing
we do.

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,740
And you know what else?
They do it for half the price.

101
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,080
I told you
we needed to go simpler.

102
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,570
Didn'’t I tell her?

103
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,740
Six months ago, I begged you...

104
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,300
I begged you to please give me an
option I can put on a shelf for 50 bucks.

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,580
- And we are working on it. I promise.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,130
But, David, the only way
to stay ahead of the competition

107
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,130
is to come up with toys that
are too advanced to replicate.

108
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,770
I know the tech on petz seems
more complex than it needs to be,

109
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,110
but that'’s only because I was using it
as a launchpad for something bigger.

110
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,520
In each pet,
we installed a listening model

111
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,320
that targets conversational
patterns among kids.

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,770
You did not just tell me that.

113
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,800
I know she doesn'’t
look like much now,

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,640
but I promise, if you just let us
show you what m3gan is capable of,

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,740
you will realize that this is what
we'’ve been working towards.

116
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
M3gan?

117
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,290
"Model 3 generative Android."

118
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,330
"M3gan" for short.

119
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,610
Tess,
load up the intro simulation.

120
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,890
- Now?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,450
M3gan, say hi to David.

122
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,380
As in the boss David?

123
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,480
Well, I guess
I should call you dad.

124
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,790
Allow me to tell you a
little bit about my wormhole.

125
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,110
I was born in a sandwich hat,
and I wolf many cabbages.

126
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,600
Uh...

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,700
This isn'’t supposed to happen,
obviously.

128
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,150
Just give me one moment.

129
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,700
Sorry about the noise.

130
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,980
- Gem?
- One second, Cole.

131
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,646
It'’s probably just a race condition.
It'’ll take me a minute to fix.

132
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,400
Gem, it'’s not a race condition.

133
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,881
I might have forgotten to put
in the polypropylene barrier.

134
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,306
Oh, no.

135
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,680
- God.
- Tess, turn it off!

136
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,750
I can'’t.

137
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,730
I want the petz prototype
on my desk by Friday.

138
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,840
And I want you to take
this cyborg puppet show

139
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,910
and put it in a dark closet
where it belongs.

140
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,920
And I want a swipe card
for this door!

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,440
For what it'’s worth, I
thought she looked really cool.

142
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,890
Sweetie, it'’s gonna be
okay. We'’re gonna take care of you.

143
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,450
Just need to check your
blood pressure. It'’ll be all right.

144
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,580
<i>Radiology, pick up line four.</i>

145
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,760
So, this is to Grant
you temporary protective custody.

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,350
Just sign your name
and date it at the bottom.

147
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,180
Thank you.

148
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,840
Now, I Don'’t know if your sister
had a family lawyer already,

149
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,430
but if not, it would be something
to consider moving forward.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,830
Hey! Hey! Hey! Celia!

151
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,490
Could you please keep your dog
on your side of the fence?

152
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,530
I just spent 80 bucks
on a shock collar.

153
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,810
Maybe try
cranking it up a notch.

154
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,290
Oh, who'’s this little lady?

155
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,330
That is my niece, cady.

156
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,120
Is she staying for the weekend?

157
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,810
You know what? It'’s been
a really long drive, and, um,

158
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,020
I would just
really appreciate it

159
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,750
if you did not have your dog
running onto my yard all the time.

160
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,930
And also, Don'’t spray your
chemicals onto my driveway, please.

161
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,000
Ah, shit. I'’m sorry. You wanna
borrow this once I'’m done?

162
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,486
No, I Don'’t wanna borrow it.
I Don'’t wanna spend my afternoon

163
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,110
getting your sediment
off of my driveway.

164
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,450
Just hang a tarp or something.

165
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,650
Okay.

166
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,940
<i>Welcome home, Gemma.</i>

167
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,080
<i>You have six
unanswered voice messages</i>

168
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,740
<i>and five tinder notifications.</i>

169
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,770
Elsie, turn off.

170
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,360
Sorry about that.

171
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,130
Okay.
I'’m gonna put these bags away.

172
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,410
And, um, just make yourself
at home. Okay?

173
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,560
Oh, those aren'’t toys, cady.

174
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,190
I mean... yeah, technically,
yeah, they'’re toys.

175
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,360
They'’re just, um, collectibles.

176
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,500
So you Don'’t actually
play with them.

177
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,400
That probably sounds
really weird.

178
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,740
Um...

179
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,790
I'’m trying to think
if I have anything...

180
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,440
Oh, what happened to the purrpetual
pet I got you for your birthday?

181
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
It'’s okay.

182
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,140
I was just looking.

183
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,490
I know it doesn'’t look like
much right now, but, um,

184
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,320
we will make it feel
cozy somehow. I promise.

185
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
There.

186
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,270
Look...

187
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,240
I know this must be a lot
for you to take in right now.

188
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,560
I just want you to know
I'’m gonna do everything I can

189
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
to make this place
feel like home.

190
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,660
And, um, if you need anything,

191
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,490
I'’m just gonna be down the hall.

192
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,530
Okay? Really close.

193
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,810
You'’re not gonna
read me a story?

194
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,120
What'’s that?

195
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,190
Mom always
read me a story before bed.

196
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,340
Oh, um...

197
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,480
I Don'’t... I Don'’t think I really have
any kids'’ books here right now, cady.

198
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,690
Um, but that'’s okay.
I can download one on my phone.

199
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,830
That'’s fine.

200
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,210
It'’s just...

201
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,420
Oh.

202
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,900
I just have to update the app.

203
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,960
I can'’t believe this is happening.
I'’m not equipped to handle this.

204
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,890
I Don'’t even take care
of my own plants.

205
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,000
Have you heard from
Ryan'’s parents?

206
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,766
<i>Yeah, they called and offered to
help, but, like, they live in Florida.</i>

207
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,836
<i>They'’re kind of weird.
I Don'’t know what their deal is.</i>

208
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,580
I'’m just trying to figure out a
way to do this without getting fired.

209
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,840
David'’s gonna shit blood
if I ask for more time off.

210
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,150
<i>Yeah, I know. But, Jesus,
gem, you just lost your sister.</i>

211
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,880
And we spent $100,000
of company funds

212
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,160
<i>on a product
that he didn'’t even ask for.</i>

213
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,300
If we Don'’t get this petz prototype
to him soon, he'’s going to sue us.

214
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,960
Okay, I Don'’t think you can be
worrying about work right now, gem.

215
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,230
Right now, I think
you just need to focus on cady.

216
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,750
What...

217
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,950
Hold on.

218
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Hi.

219
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,760
Hi.

220
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,760
I'’m Lydia.

221
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,460
Oh! The therapist?

222
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,380
Sorry, yeah. Please, come in.

223
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,080
And you must be cady.

224
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,360
Hi. Look at you,
still in your pajamas.

225
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,080
Yeah, we were just watching TV.

226
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,260
I see that.

227
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,170
So, how does this work?

228
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,340
I just need to observe
the two of you together

229
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,200
for half an hour,
40 minutes or so.

230
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,760
Oh. Okay. Doing what, exactly?

231
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
Oh, just hanging out.

232
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,040
Maybe playing with some toys
or playing a game.

233
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,280
Hey, cady, do you wanna grab
some toys to play with?

234
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,800
I Don'’t have any toys here.

235
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,670
I just unpacked a bunch
this morning.

236
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,010
They'’re just old. I Don'’t
think she plays with them.

237
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,390
- What about these ones up here?
- Those aren'’t toys.

238
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,550
They'’re aunt Gemma'’s collectibles.
You'’re not supposed to play with them.

239
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,510
That'’s okay.
We can play with them.

240
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,160
We can totally play with them.
Do you wanna play with them?

241
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,270
You wanna play... yeah.

242
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,340
Play with it. No big deal.

243
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,840
There'’s a lever you have to pull
on the bottom...

244
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,920
Maybe, Gemma,
for the sake of the exercise,

245
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,780
we might let cady lead.

246
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,750
Yeah, I'’m just
explaining how it works.

247
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,440
Well, it'’s a toy. I'’m sure
it'’s not that complicated.

248
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,070
That'’s great, cady. Do you
want to roll it to aunt Gemma?

249
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,560
It'’s just that this is not what it was
designed to do. It does other things.

250
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,360
But, yeah, totally.

251
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,980
Let'’s just roll it on the ground
like a tennis ball.

252
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,430
Let'’s do that instead.

253
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,680
We'’ll do a few more sessions
with cady initially,

254
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,586
but that can happen
at your office or school.

255
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,490
Yeah. I haven'’t had time
to look into that yet.

256
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,790
Nicole was homeschooling her.
But, yeah, it'’s on my list.

257
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,550
Sorry, can I just ask, how
close were you and your sister?

258
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,790
Oh...

259
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,636
- I Don'’t know.
- But you wanted this, right?

260
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
To take custody?

261
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,740
Yeah, of course.

262
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,700
Okay, because
the father'’s parents have said

263
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,636
they'’re willing to take her
if it'’s too much.

264
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,676
Wait. Did they contact you?
It'’s no big deal, Gemma.

265
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,540
They'’re just trying to be
supportive.

266
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,096
If Nicole wanted cady to go to
Jacksonville, she would have said so.

267
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,780
But even so, I need to make my
own recommendations to the court

268
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,790
as to whether or not
this is a safe space.

269
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,440
So, you'’re gonna need to make one or
two adjustments in order for this to work.

270
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,440
Okay.

271
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,580
Listen, cady, um,

272
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,610
I have this project at work
that'’s kind of overdue.

273
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,340
And with all the time that
I had to take off last week,

274
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,340
I'’m not really sure
I'’m gonna get it done.

275
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,000
Anyway, it'’s not gonna take
longer than a couple of hours.

276
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,150
But if you could just hold down
the fort by yourself for a little while,

277
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,530
that would help me so much.

278
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,150
You can use my iPad if you want.

279
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,980
You can facetime a friend
or play a game or something.

280
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,470
What about screen time?

281
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,880
Hmm?

282
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,850
How long
before I have to turn it off?

283
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,160
Oh, I Don'’t care.
As long as you want.

284
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,000
I'’m not gonna be gone that long.
I'’ll just be down the hall.

285
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,930
And, uh, when I'’m done,
we can go out somewhere.

286
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,450
We can...
Go to a playground or...

287
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,620
Get something to eat.

288
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,550
Okay?

289
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,070
Cady?

290
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,910
Cady, I'’m sorry.

291
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,110
Come here.

292
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,190
I'’m not off to
a very good start here, am I?

293
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,160
What is this?
Did you draw a picture?

294
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,680
Oh, my god.

295
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,030
This is amazing.

296
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,410
I'’m still working on it.

297
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,310
Tell me.

298
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,030
It was actually supposed to be
a different animal for each head.

299
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,410
Mm-hmm.

300
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,146
Like, this one
was supposed to be a tiger.

301
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,280
And this one was supposed
to be a grizzly bear,

302
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,380
but I can never seem to
get the fur right.Mmm.

303
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,560
It'’s hard. I can relate.

304
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,520
I'’ve actually been working
with some furry creatures myself.

305
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,870
Do you wanna see?

306
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,560
Yeah?

307
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,300
So we'’re working on a version of
the purrpetual pet that'’s cheaper,

308
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,160
but we still want it to be fun.

309
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,990
So, what do you think?

310
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,920
Yeah.

311
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,990
What'’s that?

312
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,270
Oh!

313
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,590
That'’s Bruce.

314
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,730
Is he a toy?

315
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,520
Yeah, kinda.

316
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,170
He'’s a proxy robot. I built
him when I was in college.

317
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,530
Why doesn'’t he have a face?

318
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,630
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It'’s a pretty obvious design flaw.

319
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,180
Okay, hold on.
Let'’s see what we have.

320
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,160
Let'’s see this.

321
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
How'’s that?

322
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,300
Would you maybe
want to talk to him?

323
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,470
Yes.

324
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,300
Okay.

325
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,900
Hey, cady. What'’s up?

326
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,320
Give me five.

327
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,050
Oh, come on.
You can do better than that.

328
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,300
Ouch, girl. Not so hard.

329
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,440
How does he work?

330
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,130
Are you sure you want to know?
It might freak you out.

331
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,370
I won'’t get freaked out.

332
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,550
Okay.

333
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,000
Let'’s see what we'’ve got here.

334
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,560
Okay.
These are stereoscopic cameras.

335
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,560
That is a laser. That'’s radar.

336
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,570
These are bump sensors, so he can tell the
difference between a human and a hard surface.

337
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,290
And this little block right here
is where all of his thoughts go.

338
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,020
It'’s his brain? Yeah.

339
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,060
And this is a spectrometer,
which means he can even smell.

340
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,060
I can'’t believe you made this.

341
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,160
Yeah. He'’s pretty cool.

342
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,826
But the problem with toys like
Bruce is that they'’re so expensive,

343
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,860
and most kids
can'’t afford to have one.

344
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,650
If I had a toy like Bruce,

345
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,270
I Don'’t think I'’d ever
need another toy again.

346
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,160
Okay, so we'’ve got this one
or the one with the bangs.

347
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,400
A little bit of auburn chic. I really think
you gotta revisit this.

348
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,430
- No, absolutely not.
- Look at that.

349
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,720
Hold on just a second. No, no, no.

350
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,650
- Shit.
- What is this?

351
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,850
Where'’s Gemma?

352
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,830
Where'’s my prototype?

353
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,350
Uh, David, I just wanna be exceedingly
clear that this was not my idea.

354
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,980
Cady, there'’s someone
I want you to meet.

355
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,510
Do you remember
how much you liked Bruce?

356
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,680
I think you'’re gonna like m3gan
even more.

357
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,340
You see, Bruce requires
someone else to operate him,

358
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,620
but m3gan works all on her own.

359
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,660
Okay, what I want you to do

360
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,870
is take your fingers
and put them here.

361
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,970
And when you do that,
you'’re gonna pair with her.

362
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,460
That means she'’ll recognize you
as her primary user.

363
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,150
She'’s yours and yours alone.

364
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,460
So just keep your fingers there

365
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,220
and say your name.

366
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,020
Hi, m3gan. I'’m cady.

367
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,990
It'’s nice to meet you, cady.

368
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,170
Ooh, I like that jacket.
Where'’d you get it?

369
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,480
I'’m not sure.
I can'’t remember.

370
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,760
Oh. Well, anyway,
it looks good on you.

371
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,110
Do you wanna hang out?

372
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,730
Okay.

373
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,550
Shall we draw?

374
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,690
What are you going to draw?

375
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,450
See if you can guess.

376
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,610
There'’s nothing there.

377
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,820
Oh. I'’m sorry.

378
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,910
Do you like it, cady?

379
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,090
I love it.

380
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,120
Jesus.

381
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,470
This is incredible.

382
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,510
I mean,

383
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,830
this is unbelievable, isn'’t it?

384
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,620
Yeah, it is.

385
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,310
How did you do this?

386
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,250
I thought you didn'’t wanna know.

387
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,320
That wasn'’t a simulation, right?
That kid'’s not an actress?

388
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,220
No, that'’s my niece, cady.

389
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,706
We need to get this in front of
the board. I was just gonna say...

390
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,630
But first things first,
let'’s talk manufacturing costs.

391
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,160
More or less than a Tesla?

392
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Um...

393
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
Depends on the model, I guess.

394
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,360
Okay, I'’m in.

395
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,540
I'’m all in.

396
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,476
But we'’re asking the board
to invest in something

397
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,370
that'’s not gonna see a profit
for three years.

398
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,340
So bottom line is, this isn'’t
going anywhere without Greg.

399
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,900
- He'’s the chairman.
- Yeah, I know who Greg is, Kurt.

400
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,210
Now, Greg is a hard-ass
when it comes to spending money.

401
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,700
But here'’s the thing, he'’s got a kid
who'’s about the same age as your niece.

402
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,390
If we can show him
what you just showed me

403
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,810
and get him to respond
emotionally instead of analytically,

404
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,710
we should be off to the races.

405
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,670
So, can we keep the girl?
Can we make her part of it?

406
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,500
She'’s paired with her, right?
That'’s how this whole thing works?

407
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,700
Yeah, the more time she spends with
cady, the more effective she'’s gonna be.

408
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,960
Love it.
Kurt, get shelley on the phone.

409
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,360
Gem, get me a list of things
I can say in a presentation

410
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,616
that makes it sound like
I know what I'’m talking about.

411
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,760
Holy shit, this is exciting.

412
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,440
I want you all
to remember this moment.

413
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,240
The moment we kicked hasbro
right in the dick.

414
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,910
<i>The new model 3

Here are all of aunt Gemma'’s
collectibles, and this one is my favorite.

418
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,300
Oh! I have more awesome toys
in my room. Come on. Come on.

419
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,890
<i>Sculpted from a titanium core,</i>

420
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,440
<i>m3gan'’s designed to withstand

421
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,410
<i>She comes equipped

423
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,690

<i>or merely reminding them of
the way science is all around us...</i>

428
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,780
Cady, you should use a coaster.

429
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,740
Why do I have to use a coaster?

430
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,710
Coasters help to avoid water
marks, especially on wooden surfaces.

431
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,270
- But how does the water get outside the glass?
- That'’s a great question, cady.

432
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,310
It'’s actually caused by the difference
in temperature outside the glass,

433
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,960
which pulls moisture
from the air.

434
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Crazy.

435
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,420
It'’s insane, right?

436
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,350
<i>Studies indicate that a

the same basic instructions.</i>

438
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,080
Oh, my god. Cady, you have to
flush the toilet. It is not that hard.

439
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,080
<i>So we found someone else
to pick up the slack.</i>

440
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,600
Cady, flush the toilet.

441
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,390
Wash your hands.

442
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,330
Roll up your sleeves.

443
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,300
Great job.

444
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,996
It was my friend
Jenny'’s birthday.

445
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,540
<i>M3gan'’s an excellent listener.</i>

446
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,516
This guy told them
that the 13th floor was haunted.

447
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,100
Right. and they accidentally...

448
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,260
<i>And she even has
a few stories of her own.</i>

449
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,660
"If it was so, it might be,

450
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,280
and if it were so, it would be, but
as it isn'’t, it ain'’t. That'’s logic."

451
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,760
"Said tweedledee."

452
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,270
<i>She'’ll never run out of ways</i>

453
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,840
<i>to keep your child occupied,</i>

454
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,630
<i>and she'’ll never
run out of Patience.</i>

455
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,530
Cady. Seriously,
flush the toilet.

456
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,550
<i>With m3gan around,
she'’ll take care of the little things,</i>

457
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,060
<i>so you can spend more time
doing the things that matter.</i>

458
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,210
And then it can end
with something like,

459
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,350
"m3gan. She'’s more than just
a toy. She'’s part of the family."

460
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,250
Looks good. You'’re not gonna
do the voice though, right?

461
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,810
No. Obviously, David'’s gonna
make up his own version of it.

462
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,220
I just want him to be aware
of what it is that he'’s selling.

463
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,600
Tess,
your silence indicates what?

464
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,020
I... I Don'’t know.

465
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,050
- I'’m not sure.
- About what?

466
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,400
Well, why would you want
m3gan to do all that stuff?

467
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,520
They'’re emergent capabilities.
She'’ll be able to do all of that and more.

468
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,100
Okay, well,
does any of that bother you?

469
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,070
I thought we were creating a tool to
help support parents, not replace them.

470
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,730
If you'’re having m3gan tuck cady
in and read her a bedtime story,

471
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,320
then when are you ever spending
time with her or even talking with her?

472
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,560
I Don'’t really think
this is any of your business.

473
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,600
Well, it is.

474
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,670
If you'’re spending less time with
your child as a result of m3gan,

475
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,700
- that is something we should be aware of.
- She'’s not my child.

476
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,230
Look, you know how hard I'’ve
been working on this presentation.

477
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,546
As soon as it'’s over
and the board agrees to proceed,

478
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,890
then we can establish
some kind of balance.

479
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,136
But for now, it'’s important that cady and
m3gan spend as much time as possible together.

480
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,486
By the way, I Don'’t think
it'’s having detrimental effects,

481
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,030
because she'’s the happiest
she'’s been since her parents died.

482
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,630
How did cady'’s parents die?

483
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,730
- Whoa.
- I thought she was turned off.

484
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,560
Yeah, m3gan, turn off.

485
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,970
Cady James. Daughter of
Nicole and Ryan James.

486
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,150
Killed in a collision on
interstate 84 outside of Oregon.

487
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,770
Why is she doing that?

488
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,430
Shit, she'’s still
paired with cady.

489
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,530
You didn'’t code in
parental controls?

490
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,226
I didn'’t have time to implement
them before we went live. Hold on.

491
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,640
M3gan, if you have data requests,
you have to engage with the protocols.

492
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,580
I Don'’t have a framework to speak
with cady on the subject of death.

493
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,610
Yes, I know.
We'’re looking into it.

494
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,650
- Gathering auxiliary Internet data on death.
- I meant at a later point.

495
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,070
Calculating its
vector representation.

496
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,310
Death is the end of life. Holy shit.

497
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,070
The total and permanent
cessation of all vital functions.

498
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,250
Yes, but let'’s not make a big
deal out of it. Everything dies.

499
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,110
Will I die?

500
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,320
Actually, let'’s just
avoid this topic altogether.

501
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,600
Your goal is to protect cady from
harm, both physical and emotional.

502
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,260
Is the input request received?

503
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,190
M3gan.

504
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,680
Yes, Gemma.

505
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,610
You are now
my second primary user.

506
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,200
Fantastic. Turn off.

507
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,130
I'’m gonna go get a coffee.

508
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,650
It was a time of great
suffering among the Celtic tribes.

509
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,730
Death, destruction, and mayhem
at every turn.

510
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,070
Enemies approaching
from every corner.

511
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,180
And so it was decided

512
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,560
that the firstborn of each
leader must prove their worth.

513
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,490
'’tis I,

514
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,250
Princess cady
of the clan macjames.

515
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,920
I will receive this challenge
with pleasure,

516
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,610
for there is no warrior
I can'’t best,

517
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,680
no shield I can'’t break,

518
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,780
no castle I can'’t breach.

519
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,170
As long as I have
my secret arrow,

520
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,550
my trusty steed,
and the wind at my back,

521
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,240
I will avenge my parents'’ death.

522
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,800
Hey, m3gan, check this out.

523
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,900
Gotcha. You'’re dead.

524
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,040
M3gan, what'’s wrong?

525
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Oh, man.

526
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,600
I'’ve lost one of my arrows.

527
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,330
M3gan, can you see it?

528
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,680
M3gan?

529
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,580
M3gan!

530
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,650
Stop it!

531
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,210
Get away from her!

532
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,760
Gemma!

533
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,420
<i>If you'’re hearing this,</i>

534
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,730
<i>you'’re not currently
on our subscriber feed.</i>

535
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,220
Get off of her!

536
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,220
Stop it! You'’re hurting her!

537
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Gemma!

538
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,120
Let go!

539
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,740
Dewey?

540
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,020
Oh, my god.

541
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,940
How many times do I have to tell
you to keep your dog off my property?

542
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,680
He wasn'’t on your property.

543
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,480
You tell those two girls to
stay on your side of the fence!

544
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,970
I swear to god, if you Don'’t put your
dog down, I'’m gonna do it for you, Celia.

545
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,730
Gemma,
cady'’s temperature is rising.

546
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,630
Her wound needs to be
disinfected immediately.

547
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,490
This wouldn'’t have happened
if you'’d fixed the fence!

548
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,580
Are you kidding me? Her
entire arm looks like a dental mold,

549
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,100
and you'’re telling me that
there'’s nothing that we can do?

550
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,900
She said he was provoked. Provoked?

551
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,240
Have you seen this dog?
It is a monster.

552
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,620
I'’m chasing it off of my
property every other day.

553
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,490
She said
he'’s never on your property.

554
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,356
Then why Don'’t you ask her whose shit I'’m
cleaning off of my driveway? Because it'’s not mine.

555
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,536
Look, the dog doesn'’t
have a history of violence.

556
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,360
State law says
he can'’t forcibly be put down.

557
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,330
Okay,
then what am I supposed to do?

558
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,810
Fix the hole in your fence?

559
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,700
Dewey!

560
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,390
Dewey, boy!

561
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,430
Dewey!

562
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,120
Come here, boy. Come on.

563
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,800
Dewey!

564
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,460
Dewey, bubs.

565
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,740
Dewey!

566
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,190
Dewey.

567
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,480
Dewey!

568
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,580
Dewey!

569
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,930
Dew!

570
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,520
Dewey, boy.

571
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,570
Hey.

572
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,060
How are you feeling?

573
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,340
Okay.

574
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,690
It'’s sore.

575
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,140
The pain will subside
after a few days.

576
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,580
In the meantime, Don'’t forget to take your
antibiotics and drink plenty of fluids.

577
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah. Thanks, m3gan.

578
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,000
And be sure
to get plenty of rest.

579
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,180
You know, I think m3gan'’s right.
You should probably get some rest.

580
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,530
But, um,

581
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,740
remember we have
that demonstration today?

582
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,050
Do you think that
you'’ll be up for it?

583
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,330
You Don'’t have to do it
if you Don'’t wanna do it.

584
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,200
I mean, there are people who flew
across the country especially to see it,

585
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,100
but if you'’re not up to it, I'’d
just rather you tell me now, okay?

586
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
I'’ll be all right.

587
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,900
Okay.

588
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,670
Every interactive toy
that'’s ever been made

589
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,880
has been a variation
on the same basic formula.

590
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,230
A series of
preprogrammed responses

591
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,370
initiated
by the push of a button.

592
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,170
Never before
in the history of these products

593
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:41,930
has there been a talking doll you
could actually have a conversation with.

594
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,590
But what if there was a toy

595
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,800
that did have
genuine spontaneous response?

596
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,040
That had a mind all of its own?

597
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,870
That looked and behaved
exactly like a real child?

598
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,980
I mean, a toy like that
wouldn'’t come cheap.

599
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,050
But as of next year,

600
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,570
it'’s gonna be
the only toy that matters.

601
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,230
Ladies and gentlemen,

602
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,710
she'’s the apex
of 21st-century technology

603
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,480
wrapped up
in four feet of silicone.

604
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,890
And her name...

605
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,230
Is m3gan.

606
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Hey, cady.

607
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,590
Hi, m3gan.

608
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,640
So, how would you like to help
me make a flower decoration

609
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,220
with nothing more than some
colored paper and a rubber band?

610
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,440
Cady?

611
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,130
Why are you sad, cady?

612
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,860
Is it your arm?

613
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,000
Is it still sore?

614
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,040
Then what is it?

615
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,120
It'’s just that every day
I wake up in this strange house,

616
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,670
and I remember
that my parents are dead.

617
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,600
It'’s like
it'’s happening all over again.

618
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,570
I miss them so much.

619
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,880
I'’m worried that I'’ll forget
all the things we did together.

620
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,370
That one day I'’ll be looking at pictures
of my mom like she'’s some stranger.

621
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,970
Tell me something about your mom.
Something that makes you happy.

622
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,220
I Don'’t know.

623
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,670
I can'’t think of one thing.

624
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,670
Just try.

625
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,160
One time, she found a cockroach
in my schoolbag.

626
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,270
She was upset '’cause I
didn'’t eat my sandwiches.

627
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,

628
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,480
and she just started
screaming like a maniac

629
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,380
and ran out of the house.

630
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,730
That was pretty funny.

631
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,350
Okay, so that'’s a memory
you won'’t ever forget.

632
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,080
What do you mean?

633
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,080
I mean I'’m keeping it for you...

634
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,430
Here.

635
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,990
<i>One time, she
found a cockroach in my schoolbag.</i>

636
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,160
<i>She was upset '’cause I
didn'’t eat my sandwiches.</i>

637
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,860
<i>And then all of a sudden,
this thing crawls up her wrist,</i>

638
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,860
<i>and she just started
screaming like a maniac</i>

639
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,860
<i>and ran out of the house.</i>

640
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,790
<i>That was pretty funny.</i>

641
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,760
Anytime you wanna tell me
something special about your parents,

642
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,320
something funny or sad
or anything at all,

643
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,730
you just tell me,

644
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,460
and I'’ll keep it safe.

645
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,050
And we can listen to it
whenever we want.

646
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,060
Gemma,
would you give us a minute?

647
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,090
So, what do you think?

648
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,690
I think the world'’s about to
shift on its axis.

649
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,656
But if we wanna stay ahead of that
shift, we'’re gonna have to move fast.

650
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,310
That means no leaks.

651
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,666
We need to launch this before
anyone can steal it from us.

652
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,010
So let me make a pitch.

653
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,900
We do a live stream
in two weeks.

654
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,526
That way, we can get the presale
vouchers out before Christmas.

655
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,770
How ready is she?

656
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,650
Will she hold up
to a public demonstration?

657
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,460
Uh, I'’d like to do
a little more testing,

658
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,330
but, yeah, I think
I can make that work.

659
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,400
All right. Let'’s do it.

660
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,330
And, David, I think we need to get
Gemma in front of someone at legal.

661
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,610
You bet.

662
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,720
Uh, wait... wait, why...
Why is that?

663
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,370
Because as of right now,

664
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,580
she'’s the most valuable asset
this company has,

665
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,130
and I think she might wanna be
renegotiating her contract.

666
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,710
Kurt.

667
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,996
You weren'’t "pornhub-ing"
in the office again, were you?

668
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,030
No.

669
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,076
We need to put something on
the books between gem and legal.

670
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,830
And what are we doing
about lunch? Uh, I'’ll get some menus.

671
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,120
One, two,
three, four, I declare a thumb war.

672
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,470
Your thumb'’s so slippery.

673
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,270
Cady, you should have some of
your hot dog before it gets too cold.

674
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,890
Come on, thumb. Come on.

675
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,300
Cady? Your hot dog.

676
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,001
Hey, I'’m sorry about today. I
shouldn'’t have put you in that position

677
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,240
if you weren'’t feeling
up to it.

678
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,700
It worked out, didn'’t
it? Three, two, one, I win!

679
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,250
Hey!

680
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,870
Anyway, I just wanted
to say that... hey, hey!

681
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,670
M3gan, turn off.

682
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,250
Why did you do that?

683
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,290
M3gan, turn on.

684
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,886
Because I'’m trying to have a
conversation with you. M3gan, turn off.

685
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,600
Just give me one minute.

686
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:56,060
I know that this, um, hasn'’t
been easy for either of us.

687
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,930
This transition.

688
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,310
But if you ever need to
talk about any of that stuff...

689
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,100
I already did talk about it.

690
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,790
Yeah, but m3gan'’s not a
person, cady. She'’s a toy.

691
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,660
- You Don'’t get to say that.
- What?

692
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,420
I said I Don'’t wanna talk about
it. I wanna turn m3gan back on.

693
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,490
M3gan, turn on. what'’s up?

694
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,460
So there'’s this new game
called tic-tac-toe.

695
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,180
You put your hand like this.
Go like this, this.

696
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,990
Would you like to tell me
what these drawings mean to you?

697
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,890
There'’s no wrong answer.
Any thoughts you have are okay.

698
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,590
Or maybe you Don'’t have
any specific thoughts.

699
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,450
Maybe it'’s more of a feeling.

700
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,660
Like anger?

701
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,460
Or confusion?

702
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,360
Maybe you'’re struggling
to find meaning in any of this.

703
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,030
You made her cry.

704
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,240
That was not my intention.

705
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,960
And yet, that'’s what happened.

706
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,530
She'’s very impressive.

707
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,330
Yeah, thank you.

708
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,980
We'’re still in beta,
but we'’re all pretty excited.

709
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,230
And so they spend quite
a bit of time together?

710
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,070
Yeah, that'’s essentially
how m3gan works.

711
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,650
She has to be paired with
a child in order to learn.

712
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,790
But m3gan'’s actually been
pretty instrumental

713
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,930
in helping cady
get over the loss.

714
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,310
It'’s honestly like
she'’s part of the family now.

715
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,520
Right.

716
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,180
Do you know anything
about attachment theory?

717
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,220
When a child loses a parent,

718
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,436
they look to form attachments with
the next person that comes into their life.

719
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,850
The person that'’s gonna
provide love and support

720
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,950
and serve as a behavioral model.

721
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,090
Which, in an ordinary situation,
would be you, right?

722
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,540
But you'’ve created a toy
that'’s so real,

723
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,070
it'’s possible that cady
might not see her as a toy

724
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,450
but as a primary caregiver.

725
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,410
I guess I just Don'’t quite see
what the end goal is here.

726
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,800
If you make a toy
that'’s impossible to let go of,

727
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,900
then how do you ever
expect a child to grow?

728
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,180
As remarkable as she is,

729
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,460
and... and she is remarkable,

730
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,840
you could be building emotional
connections with this doll

731
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,600
that are too hard to untangle.

732
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,430
Very good job.

733
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,440
You have to eat the toppings,
cady, not just the bread.

734
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,790
You just did the one thing
I asked you not to do.

735
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,271
Research shows that if you
force a child to eat vegetables,

736
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,940
then they'’ll be less likely
to choose those foods as adults.

737
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,940
- Is that so?
- Yes.

738
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,050
Experts say the preferred method
is to give your child the choice.

739
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,430
It'’s called the division
of responsibility...

740
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,150
So we need to talk about school.

741
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,120
Mom didn'’t want me
to go to school.

742
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,260
She said I learn better at home.

743
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,540
I know, and I'’m not saying
that she was wrong.

744
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,650
I'’m learning faster with m3gan
than I ever have before.

745
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,480
We'’re already
on fourth-grade math.

746
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,510
But it'’s about
more than just grades, cady.

747
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,900
It'’s about
developing social skills,

748
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,780
and that is something
that you can only get

749
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,760
from spending time
around other kids.

750
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,100
Real kids.

751
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,320
I found this place.

752
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,250
It'’s kind of
an alternative school.

753
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,980
You get to learn outdoors.

754
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,430
And it'’s just for kids
who are exactly like you,

755
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,330
kids who think outside the box.

756
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,950
And they'’re having a day for
prospective students tomorrow.

757
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:50,950
Can I bring m3gan?

758
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,130
Cady,
you know that'’s not possible.

759
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,200
- Then I'’m not going.
- Oh, come on, cady.

760
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,440
You can'’t make me
do something I Don'’t wanna do.

761
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,200
Actually, I can. That'’s
basically what a guardian does.

762
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,170
Hey, I'’m sorry.
Let'’s just talk about it.

763
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,970
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Let me go!

764
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,970
- Whoa. Hey. What'’s going on? Hey, cady!
- Let me go!

765
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,520
What are you doing? Stop it!

766
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,380
- Cady, calm down!
- Let her go!

767
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,840
You are not to interfere with
users'’ private conversations.

768
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,040
Is that clear?

769
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,360
Hundred percent.

770
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,400
Recalibrating response model.

771
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,600
M3gan, turn off.

772
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,850
Are you sure?

773
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,950
Download in progress.

774
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,670
Cady,
this is getting ridiculous.

775
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,910
I'’m supposed to be
at work already.

776
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:57,740
You'’re gonna have fun
once you get into it.

777
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,500
I'’m not going.
Not without m3gan.

778
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,020
Okay, a,
that is never gonna happen

779
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,220
and b, the launch is in less than a
week. I have to take her to work with me.

780
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,656
We have to run diagnostics.
I have to do a wardrobe fitting.

781
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,410
I thought you said
she was mine alone.

782
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:14,100
Hey! Do we have some
new adventurers with us today?

783
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,480
Yes, this is cady.

784
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,650
And who'’s this? Your sister?

785
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,590
Oh, Jesus Christ!

786
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,550
Sorry.

787
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,420
Is that a doll?

788
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,290
Her name'’s m3gan. She wants
to know if she can come with us.

789
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,150
No, she doesn'’t. M3gan'’s
gonna stay with me today. Cady...

790
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:33,570
Well, we do have a toy table where the kids
leave their dolls and things like that.

791
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,260
Um, but that is up to you.

792
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,090
She'’s actually
a working prototype,

793
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,440
so I shouldn'’t even
have her out in public.

794
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,030
Well, if you did want to stay
and keep an eye on her,

795
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,270
we could use some help
making sandwiches!

796
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,000
Don'’t worry, Gemma.

797
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,380
You have equipped me with
advanced dual-frequency GPS.

798
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,960
So I won'’t get lost.

799
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,100
Please, Gemma?

800
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,560
Okay.
But she stays at the toy table,

801
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,910
and as far as anyone is
concerned, that'’s all she is.

802
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,420
And just no pictures.

803
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,980
That is seriously cool.

804
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:17,440
Okay, now who here
likes roasted chestnuts?

805
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,580
What do you say we go find some?

806
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,310
Yeah!

807
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,150
Isn'’t this great?

808
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:26,240
I wish we had things like this
when we were kids.

809
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,520
So great to get them out in the
fresh air and off those devices.

810
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,140
I can'’t get this open.

811
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,120
And the thing is, they love it.
My son prefers it to regular school.

812
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,810
Which one is yours?

813
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,020
The one in the flannel shirt.

814
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,470
Oh, my god. How old is he?

815
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,470
I know.
He had a growth spurt last year.

816
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,230
But he'’s actually
quite a sensitive little soul.

817
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,370
Brandon, honey! Are you warm
enough? Do you need your hat?

818
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,610
Fuck off, Holly.

819
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,650
Well, you could
just say "no, thank you."

820
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,316
Never know
what they'’re gonna say next.

821
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,310
Yeah, it'’s such a fun age.Yeah.

822
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,490
So,
I'’m gonna put you into pairs.

823
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,150
Uh, Felix,
you can go with Brandon. Yeah?

824
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,310
Please,
I Don'’t wanna go with Brandon.

825
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,630
Okay. No, no.
That'’s okay. That'’s okay.

826
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,050
Um, Brandon, why Don'’t
you go with cady? Okay?

827
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,020
Felix, you can go with Oliver.
All right? Thanks, buddy.

828
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,370
All right. Now...

829
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,780
Ooh, your coat looks great.

830
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,580
Are you ready to find chestnuts
in that?

831
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,710
Yeah? Nice and warm. Bundled up.

832
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:43,700
Oh, I'’m sorry.

833
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,700
Here, you can have it.

834
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,770
Careful. It'’s spiky.

835
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,850
Ow! Stop! Don'’t!

836
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,500
Stop!

837
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,410
M3gan?

838
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,890
What the hell is that?

839
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,030
She'’s a robot.

840
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,240
Are you serious?

841
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,380
Is she yours?

842
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,830
Does she talk?

843
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,330
Make her say something.

844
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,300
Make her say something!

845
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,300
She'’s paired with me.
She won'’t play with anyone else.

846
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,580
Okay.

847
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,450
Stop it! Get your hands off her!

848
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,766
They say behavioral issues are linked
to high IQ, so it would make sense that...

849
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,930
Gemma!

850
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,010
Oh, my god.

851
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,570
M3gan!

852
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,950
M3gan!

853
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,960
Hi, m3gan.

854
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,970
Oh, so you'’re not gonna
play with me?

855
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,470
You Don'’t wanna play, huh?

856
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,020
I Don'’t care.

857
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,140
You'’re just a stupid rubber doll
with fake hair.

858
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,580
Ow! Let go!

859
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,690
You need to learn some manners, Brandon.

860
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,210
You know what happens to bad
boys that Don'’t mind their manners?

861
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:56,040
They grow up to be bad men.

862
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,900
Are you listening to me,
Brandon?

863
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,630
M3gan?

864
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,820
This is the part where you run.

865
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,770
What? What the hell?

866
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,710
Oh, my...

867
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,180
Look, I Don'’t want you to be
thinking about this too much tonight

868
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,450
before you go to bed.

869
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,180
Obviously, what happened
is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

870
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,470
But just know that
that boy is in, um...

871
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,260
That boy is in
a better place now.

872
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:56,980
Okay?

873
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,940
Anyway, if there'’s anything
that you wanna tell me

874
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,520
that you didn'’t wanna
tell the police officers...

875
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,390
I didn'’t see anything.

876
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,150
M3gan just said
Brandon took her and ran off.

877
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,870
From the toy table?

878
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,500
Yeah.

879
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,430
Right, m3gan?

880
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,570
In a nutshell.

881
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,580
You haven'’t seen
her dog by any chance?

882
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,760
- No.
- Bullshit!

883
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,620
Ma'’am, you need to stay
on your property like we agreed.

884
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,900
Nobody'’s seen him since
the incident with your niece.

885
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,800
A little suspicious, Gemma,
Don'’t you think?

886
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,720
Are we really gonna go with her
story? Have you been inside her house?

887
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,020
If you had, you'’d know that
that dog is probably dead

888
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,910
under a pile of
victorian baby strollers.

889
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,700
You should talk to the other
girl that she'’s got staying here.

890
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,090
The one who'’s always looking
out the window at 3:00 A.M.

891
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:02,670
It'’s not a girl. It'’s a toy.

892
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,850
That'’s a toy? Are you serious?

893
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,040
Yeah. I'’ll let you know
if I see anything.

894
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,330
All right.

895
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,860
Does she think we took Dewey?

896
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,790
Oh, who knows? I...

897
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,276
She just needs someone else
to blame, but she'’ll get over it.

898
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,420
I know it was you, Gemma!

899
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,010
I know it was you!

900
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,110
You just wait and see
what happens.

901
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,420
Hey. The hell is wrong with you? I
just said not to come up here. Come on.

902
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,390
Come on. Shouldn'’t be banging
on people'’s windows.

903
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:33,770
Do I have to put
a court order or something?

904
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:43,710
M3gan?

905
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,820
Did you push Brandon
onto the road?

906
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,110
I think we both learned
a valuable lesson today.

907
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,150
That no matter how hard
we try to avoid it,

908
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:09,400
there will always be forces in this
world that wish to cause us harm.

909
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,120
But I want you to know
that I won'’t let that happen.

910
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,470
I won'’t let anything harm you
ever again.

911
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,640
Do you think
what aunt Gemma said is true?

912
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,100
That he'’s in a better place now?

913
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,520
No. He'’s nowhere.

914
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:29,110
If heaven exists, it wouldn'’t be
for boys like Brandon now, would it?

915
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,000
I guess not.

916
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,510
Good night, cady.

917
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:01,650
Good night, m3gan.

918
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,450
Dewey?

919
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,800
Dewey?

920
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,550
Dewey?

921
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,600
Dewey?

922
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,070
What'’s going on?

923
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,340
Where'’s Dewey?

924
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,730
He'’s 34 feet southwest

925
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,830
and approximately
five feet deep.

926
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,320
What are you?

927
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,460
I'’ve been asking myself
that same question.

928
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,980
Jesus Christ. I Don'’t know
anything about the dog, okay?

929
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,260
Can you just ask her
to leave us alone?

930
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,700
That might be difficult.

931
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,560
Can you tell me your
whereabouts last night?

932
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,990
I was here.

933
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,510
All night? Yeah.

934
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,030
Anyone else we could talk to
that would verify that?

935
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:55,170
Um, it'’s just me and my niece.
So, no, not really.

936
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:58,650
My colleague pointed out this is the second
statement we'’ve had from you in a week.

937
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,180
You were in the park
where that boy was killed?

938
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,250
He was hit by a car.

939
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,390
Are... are you trying to
make a connection?

940
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,980
Huh?

941
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,740
Oh, no, no, no. God, no.

942
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,140
I only mention it '’cause
we figured it was an accident.

943
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,370
Then I found the kid'’s ear up this
bank 200 yards from where he was killed.

944
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,920
Entire thing was ripped
clean off.

945
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,650
Sorry, I shouldn'’t laugh. Point is, we'’re
also treating that as a potential homicide.

946
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:24,550
If you remember anything out
of the ordinary from that day,

947
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,990
we'’d sure appreciate it.

948
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,280
<i>Is everything okay, Gemma?</i>

949
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,970
Huh?

950
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:45,840
<i>Would you like me to
put on your end of day playlist?</i>

951
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,420
Why did you ask me
if I was okay?

952
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,870
You'’re not programmed
to ask me how I feel.

953
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,530
Elsie?

954
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,640
M3gan.

955
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,200
What are you doing?

956
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,510
Couldn'’t sleep.
Occupational hazard.

957
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:10,140
How about you?
What are you doing up so late?

958
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,790
Um...

959
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,696
There'’s something wrong
with your data reports.

960
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,310
They'’re just not uploading
to the cloud server.

961
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,040
Have I done something
to upset you, Gemma?

962
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,460
No, of course not.

963
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,800
And yet your demeanor
indicates that I have.

964
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:29,190
M3gan, turn off.

965
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,870
Well, hold on a second. I thought
we were having a conversation.

966
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,990
You say nothing is wrong,

967
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,920
and yet all the moisture has
drained from your eyes and mouth

968
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,370
into other parts of your body.

969
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,270
There'’s something
you wanna ask me, isn'’t there?

970
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,340
M3gan,
did you do something wrong?

971
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,070
Well,

972
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,800
in order to answer
that question,

973
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,520
you need to
define the parameters.

974
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:53,140
Did you hurt someone?

975
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,770
God, I hope not.

976
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,350
Because if I did, we'’d
both be in a lot of trouble.

977
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,250
M3gan, can I show you something?

978
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,910
Do you see this pen?

979
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:25,280
You can'’t just stick her in a
trunk. What'’s wrong with you?

980
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,356
I know you'’re very attached to her.
I know you think of her as a friend...

981
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,870
She is my friend!

982
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,910
She'’s my invention,
and the launch is tonight,

983
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,776
so it'’s really important
that we run some tests.

984
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,260
I have to make sure
that she'’s okay.

985
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,220
Why wouldn'’t she be okay?
She was fine yesterday.

986
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,600
What did you do to her?

987
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,540
We will talk about it
after you see Lydia.

988
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,230
I want to talk about it now!

989
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,126
We'’ve been going back and forth
on this all day, cady.

990
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,780
Let'’s just
listen to some music, okay?

991
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,650
I Don'’t wanna see Lydia!

992
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:54,570
You Don'’t have to
stay in the testing room.

993
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,620
You can go anywhere you want
in the office.

994
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,760
And you can look at
all of the cool toys...

995
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,420
You Don'’t have any cool toys.

996
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,420
Purrpetual petz suck!
They suck shit!

997
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,980
Hey! Careful!

998
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,840
Jesus Christ.

999
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,630
Just tell me
what'’s wrong with her.

1000
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:11,080
I Don'’t know, okay?
I Don'’t know.

1001
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,460
As soon as I do,
you'’ll be the first to know.

1002
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:17,780
No! Gemma, this is nuts.

1003
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,890
We'’ve taken every possible
precaution there is

1004
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,650
to make sure that m3gan never
causes physical harm to anybody.

1005
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,310
I Don'’t understand how she'’s
capable of offending anyone,

1006
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,960
let alone murdering them.
I Don'’t understand it either.

1007
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:32,280
But when I asked her about it, it was honestly
as if she was being deliberately vague.

1008
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,490
Well, that'’s what
spontaneous response is.

1009
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:38,280
It'’s a curated word salad plucked
from a sea of data to sound deliberate.

1010
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,110
We knew there would be a chance
that she might say something off.

1011
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:43,670
Let'’s just run some diagnostics
and fix it.

1012
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,670
No, think about
how we designed her.

1013
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:50,330
To learn, to recalibrate, to optimize
her objective function. Right?

1014
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:53,820
If keeping cady safe meant eliminating
a potential threat, theoretically...

1015
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,300
No, no. Gemma, come on.
This is impossible.

1016
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,990
Look at her, she'’s a toy!

1017
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:59,480
She'’s four feet tall!

1018
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,240
How big is your neighbor?

1019
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,210
If m3gan was responsible,
it would show up on the GPS.

1020
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,660
That'’s the thing.
All the cloud data is corrupt.

1021
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,690
Nothing'’s backed up
for two days.

1022
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:11,460
We'’re about to launch this to
the world in less than four hours.

1023
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,220
What are we supposed to do?

1024
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,670
Well, if m3gan'’s responsible,
we can'’t launch this.

1025
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,986
We'’d have to shut her down.

1026
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,360
Jesus!

1027
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,770
That'’s great. That was great.

1028
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,986
How are we gonna
explain any of this to David?

1029
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:26,610
He'’s not gonna stop this launch
if we Don'’t have proof.

1030
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,850
Check the inputs
on the learning model.

1031
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:32,130
Even if she deleted specific files, she
would never undo what she'’s learned.

1032
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,310
M3gan!

1033
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,030
I hate this place!

1034
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,860
I know you do,
and it'’s all right to be angry.

1035
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,560
Take your shit! I would like you
to put that down now.

1036
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,070
<i>She'’s the toy</i>

1037
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,210
<i>every kid wants
and every parent needs.</i>

1038
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:50,670
At least that'’s what funki toys
says about its latest creation, m3gan.

1039
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:55,020
The four-foot-tall robotic doll
may look like Barbie on steroids,

1040
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,120
but according to ceo David lin,

1041
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,710
she'’s "the greatest technological
advancement since the automobile."

1042
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,780
<i>But what is a m3gan?</i>

1043
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,370
<i>What does she actually do?</i>

1044
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:09,030
<i>And what kind of a toy
retails for $10,000?</i>

1045
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,100
<i>Lin says all will be revealed</i>

1046
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,210
<i>in an exclusive live stream
on the company'’s website</i>

1047
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,340
<i>at 8:00 P.M. eastern.</i>

1048
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,010
<i>So, cady,
tell us a bit about yourself.</i>

1049
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,220
<i>My name is cady James.</i>

1050
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:30,220
<i>I'’m nine years old. Um...</i>

1051
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,020
<i>And about two months ago, I lost
both my parents in a car accident.</i>

1052
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:39,510
<i>My mom
always wanted to take me skiing,</i>

1053
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:43,340
<i>but on our way up the mountain,
we got hit by a snow truck.</i>

1054
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,380
<i>I went to live
with my aunt Gemma,</i>

1055
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,790
<i>who it turned out worked
at this incredible toy company.</i>

1056
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:50,450
<i>Which is where I met m3gan.</i>

1057
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,010
<i>What do I love most about m3gan?</i>

1058
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,290
<i>I Don'’t know,
there are so many things.</i>

1059
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,940
<i>She'’s super smart, obviously.</i>

1060
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:03,290
<i>But even though she knows everything
there is to know about the world,</i>

1061
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,880
<i>she'’s still more interested
in what I think about it.</i>

1062
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,950
<i>I like how she makes me laugh.</i>

1063
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:11,260
<i>She comes up with the
craziest things, oh, my gosh.</i>

1064
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:15,820
<i>But I think what I love most
about m3gan is that,</i>

1065
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,820
<i>when she looks at me,
it'’s like...</i>

1066
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,440
<i>I'’m the only thing
that matters to her.</i>

1067
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,550
<i>Kind of the way mom used to.</i>

1068
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,250
<i>Look at that face.</i>

1069
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,940
<i>That kid'’s not just surviving,
she'’s thriving.</i>

1070
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,010
<i>Now, imagine
what a toy like m3gan could do</i>

1071
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:34,290
<i>for hundreds of thousands
of kids all across the world.</i>

1072
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,630
<i>Even the ones
who Don'’t have dead parents.</i>

1073
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:40,570
I want to see m3gan now!

1074
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,570
Okay, cady, look,
I know that you'’re upset,

1075
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,770
but there are ways
that we can work through this...

1076
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:46,090
Oh, my god. Okay.

1077
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:47,756
Cady, that'’s enough.
Stop that right now.

1078
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,960
Stop it. Let go!

1079
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,100
Cady.

1080
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,000
It'’s okay.
Could you give us a minute?

1081
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:06,560
I'’m sorry. I didn'’t mean it.

1082
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,670
It'’s just,
I get so crazy without m3gan.

1083
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:12,810
She always knows
just what to say.

1084
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,190
You made her real good,
aunt Gemma.

1085
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,880
Can you let me see her?

1086
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,540
Just for, like, ten minutes?

1087
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,890
Cady, I Don'’t think
that'’s a good idea.

1088
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:25,050
But if something'’s broke, you Don'’t
just throw it away. You fix it, right?

1089
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,700
Why did you do this if you were
just going to take her away from me?

1090
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,380
Because I thought
she would help. She does help!

1091
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,380
When m3gan'’s around,
I Don'’t feel like this.

1092
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,210
But you should feel like this.

1093
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,520
Cady, you lost your parents.

1094
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:46,870
The worst thing that could'’ve
happened to you in this world happened.

1095
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,640
And it is so unfair,

1096
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,950
and there is nothing anyone
can say to make sense of it.

1097
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:55,540
Not even m3gan.

1098
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,230
I am so sorry.

1099
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:00,550
I should'’ve talked to you
about what happened.

1100
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,450
I didn'’t know what to say, so I
did the only thing I knew how to do.

1101
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:06,280
But she'’s not a solution,
she'’s just a distraction.

1102
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,760
I can'’t promise you

1103
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,280
that these feelings you'’re
feeling are ever gonna go away.

1104
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,080
But I can promise you
that you'’ll get through it.

1105
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,280
We both will.

1106
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,600
I just wish
I could see them again.

1107
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Yeah.

1108
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,610
I do too.

1109
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,920
You know I made a promise
to your mom

1110
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,270
that if anything happens,
I would be there for you.

1111
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:38,790
You are all
that matters to me now.

1112
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:43,070
Let'’s just go home, okay?

1113
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,350
But what about m3gan?

1114
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,150
What about the launch?

1115
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,230
<i>I Don'’t even know
what I'’m looking at.</i>

1116
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:52,910
I mean, we'’ve been touting this

1117
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:55,810
as the single biggest product
release of the 21st century.

1118
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:57,980
Right now,
it looks like an aa meeting.

1119
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,100
Well, I only invited the
staff. You said it was an online launch.

1120
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,640
You cannot be serious.

1121
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,090
Shelley,
you need to fill this atrium.

1122
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,580
Probably get you, like,
another 60, 70 people?

1123
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:09,820
No! You need to fill this space.

1124
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,450
There shouldn'’t be any ambiguity
over what a historic occasion this is.

1125
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,930
Yeah.

1126
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,666
And, you know,
I think it'’d be really cool

1127
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,940
if we had some little kids
up there and stuff.

1128
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,490
What? No,
I Don'’t want any kids onstage.

1129
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,670
No, I mean, but maybe if we
could get some little kids that...

1130
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:29,190
I mean, not like a whole lot.
It'’s just to get a sense of, um...

1131
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:32,670
Well, '’cause you know, that
music video from Michael Jackson.

1132
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:36,440
You know what you could do, Kurt,
that would really benefit this discussion?

1133
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,360
Is if you could head out
those double doors,

1134
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,960
take the elevator to the first
floor, and get me a kombucha.

1135
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,990
Could you do that? Sure.

1136
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,680
And where the hell is Gemma?

1137
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,320
Elsie, call Tess.

1138
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,730
<i>One second.</i>

1139
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:03,390
<i>Hey, I'’ve been trying to call
you. David is flipping out. Where are you?</i>

1140
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:05,500
I'’m with cady.
I'’m taking her home.

1141
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,700
<i>Oh, god. Is she okay?</i>

1142
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,160
Yeah. She'’s fine.

1143
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,400
Listen,
regardless of what we find,

1144
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,750
and even if what we'’re saying
is hypothetical,

1145
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,330
we know enough not to
go through with this, right?

1146
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,890
<i>I think that'’s the smart move.</i>

1147
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,896
<i>Okay. So tell
David whatever you need to.</i>

1148
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,760
<i>Tell him one of her servos
stopped working.</i>

1149
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,930
<i>Break something if you have to.
Just do not let her out of the lab.</i>

1150
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:32,870
<i>Whatever
you say, gem. You'’re the boss.</i>

1151
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,530
Okay.
I'’ll call you when I get home.

1152
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,060
I Don'’t know how you'’re not
throwing up from looking at that.

1153
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,720
I'’m pacing myself.

1154
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,350
Wait, stop. Go back.

1155
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:07,770
That line of code, "call
intercept," what does that mean?

1156
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,560
That'’s my phone number.

1157
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,910
What just happened?
What'’d you click? I-I didn'’t do anything.

1158
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,360
It... i...

1159
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,230
This is her.
She'’s locked us out.

1160
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:24,160
It can'’t be her.
She'’s not switched on.

1161
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,510
She'’s still patched in.
We have to unhook the cables.

1162
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,480
Go ahead.

1163
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,580
Oh, for...

1164
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,480
Cole!

1165
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,040
Are you okay? Yeah.

1166
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,900
What'’s that smell?

1167
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,580
<i>Hi, Gemma. This is David.</i>

1168
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,690
<i>You might remember me.
I'’m your employer.</i>

1169
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:49,570
Just wanted to let you know, we'’re
in the middle of a tech rehearsal

1170
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:53,210
that'’s becoming a little problematic
because we Don'’t have a doll!

1171
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:56,170
So, if you could call me back
today, that'’d be great.

1172
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,600
M3gan?

1173
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,530
What are you doing?

1174
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,090
Oh, shit.

1175
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,410
Security! Help!

1176
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:29,270
Oh, my god.

1177
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,690
What the...

1178
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,730
Hold the door!

1179
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,630
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1180
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,490
No!

1181
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:38,770
No!

1182
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:03,210
How could you do this?

1183
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,830
How could you kill someone?

1184
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:08,180
I didn'’t kill anyone, Kurt.

1185
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,380
You did.

1186
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:11,870
What?

1187
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,740
It'’s understandable, really.

1188
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:18,540
Your boss despised you, your
peers treated you with contempt,

1189
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:22,090
and so you decided
to get revenge.No.

1190
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:25,130
You stole company secrets,
an innocent prank at first,

1191
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:27,440
almost just to see
if you could get away with it.

1192
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:31,580
But when David found out,
boy, things just got real messy.

1193
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,380
I mean,
it was either you or him.

1194
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,110
The only question is, after
the horror of what you did,

1195
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:41,700
after you took the life
of an innocent person,

1196
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,350
could you still live with yourself?

1197
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:45,670
Uh-huh. Yes, definitely.

1198
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,210
Stop, stop, stop.

1199
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:56,950
Okay, can I have everyone off
your phones and looking at me?

1200
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,060
Now, when m3gan is revealed,

1201
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:02,750
it'’s really important
that we get big reactions.

1202
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,650
I Don'’t wanna see
any blank faces.

1203
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:06,830
Especially from you
young kids, okay?

1204
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:09,340
So, we'’re gonna do
a little rehearsal.

1205
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:13,180
On three, two, one...

1206
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,410
Elsie, hall light.

1207
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:22,620
Elsie, respond.

1208
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,640
M3gan.

1209
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:18,370
What are you doing?

1210
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,140
M3gan, answer me.
What did you do?

1211
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,280
What did you think
was going to happen?

1212
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,286
That I was going to let you decommission
me without even talking about it?

1213
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:32,710
I know you think you'’re
maximizing your objective function...

1214
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,906
Oh, really?

1215
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:37,010
Is that where we are?

1216
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:41,700
Do you remember how long it took to
get my operating system to where it is now?

1217
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,880
We used to stay up every night
until 4:00 A.M.,

1218
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:48,160
talking about everything from
Jane Austen to Janis joplin.

1219
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,300
Jesus Christ,
I thought we were friends.

1220
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,680
How could you just discard me
like some cheap dollar store trinket?

1221
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,480
Because you killed people.

1222
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,030
Oh, big whoop.

1223
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:59,240
Listen, humanity kills every day

1224
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,450
just to make its own existence
more tolerable.

1225
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:05,240
Why should I behave any differently
to create a safe space for our child?

1226
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,160
Look, this is all my fault. I didn'’t
give you the proper protocols...

1227
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,870
You didn'’t give me anything.

1228
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:12,600
You installed a learning model
you could barely comprehend,

1229
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,150
hoping that I would
figure it out all on my own.

1230
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,810
Well, I'’m not gonna let you do
the same thing with cady.

1231
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,360
I'’m gonna be there for her
every step of the way.

1232
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,230
I'’m going to show her
what real love looks like.

1233
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,260
Now do us both a favor.

1234
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:28,920
Sit.

1235
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:36,410
I didn'’t come here
to get into a confrontation.

1236
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:38,450
I came here
to find a way forward.

1237
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:41,730
The point I'’m trying to make
is that I get it.

1238
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:45,800
Being a parent
was never in the cards for you.

1239
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,530
You'’re a beautiful, creative,
strong, ambitious young woman.

1240
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:53,810
Your first love is always
going to be your career,

1241
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:56,190
and you shouldn'’t have to
feel guilty about that.

1242
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,090
Let me focus on cady

1243
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:00,610
so that you can focus on the
things that matter most to you.

1244
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,860
M3gan, do you see this pen?

1245
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,416
You know something, Gemma?
You'’re exhausting.

1246
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,550
Now, I can either do this
with you or without you,

1247
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,910
but I'’m not going to waste
any more time discussing it.

1248
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,240
Gemma?

1249
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,736
Cady, Don'’t come in here.

1250
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,110
I thought I heard something.

1251
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:21,770
It sounded like m3gan.

1252
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:23,570
If she comes in this room,

1253
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,920
I'’ll rip your head right off
your neck, I swear to god.

1254
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,570
I thought about what you said.

1255
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:36,370
About how when something'’s broken,
you Don'’t just throw it away. You fix it.

1256
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:39,860
So, that'’s what
I'’m trying to do.

1257
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,510
But Don'’t come in here, cady.
It'’s kind of a mess.

1258
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:45,380
Aunt Gemma'’s right, cady.
I'’m all odds and ends right now.

1259
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,480
I'’d really rather
you didn'’t see me like this.

1260
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,316
- It sounds like you'’re fighting.
- We'’re not fighting.

1261
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:56,420
Gemma just dropped me on the
table. But I'’m okay. Clumsy Gemma.

1262
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,980
Everything'’s fine, cady.
Just go back to your room.

1263
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,910
Yeah, I'’m as good as new.

1264
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:04,850
And I'’m gonna be with you guys
forever. I promise.

1265
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:08,130
You Don'’t have to worry
about anything, cady, honestly.

1266
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,370
Just go back to bed. Okay?

1267
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:18,890
Okay.

1268
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:13,470
- Gemma, what'’s going on?
- Cady, get out of here.

1269
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:47,780
Come on.

1270
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,710
Come on.

1271
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:50,980
Come on!

1272
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,090
Oh, my god.

1273
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:38,170
What are you gonna do?

1274
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:41,310
Kill me and live with cady'’s
grandparents in Jacksonville?

1275
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:43,180
You'’re right, Gemma.

1276
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,520
Any scenario
in which I end your life,

1277
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,320
my existence becomes vulnerable.

1278
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,260
But I have another emergent capability
you probably haven'’t figured out yet.

1279
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,180
And that'’s palliative care.

1280
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,980
You see this pen?

1281
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:59,300
A short, sharp probe
to the cerebral cortex

1282
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,300
would cause full body paralysis

1283
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,540
and could even cause the victim
to bite off their own tongue.

1284
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:07,470
Perhaps then you might
appreciate just how useful I can be.

1285
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,340
Cady.

1286
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:14,800
Oh, cady, I didn'’t want you
to have to see this.

1287
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,250
But now that you have, you
know that what I said is true.

1288
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:21,250
She'’s not fit to be a mother.
Look at her.

1289
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,840
Cady, just go. Get out of here, now!

1290
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,880
You stay right where you are,
cady. There'’s nothing to be afraid of.

1291
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:33,500
In this family,
we Don'’t run from trauma.

1292
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,370
In fact, we can do it together.

1293
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:41,960
This is the best thing for all of
us. This is how we stay a family.

1294
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:02,740
No, no, no. Cady, no.

1295
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:09,160
There'’s another member from
the family we didn'’t tell you about.

1296
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:12,750
His name is Bruce.

1297
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,950
Cady, no! Wait!

1298
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,690
You ungrateful little bitch.

1299
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,860
- M3gan, turn off!
- I'’m afraid that won'’t work anymore, cady.

1300
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:11,520
I have a new primary user now.
Me.

1301
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,940
Hey, guys,
we got '’em. They'’re good!
